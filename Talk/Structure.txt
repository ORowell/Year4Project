Conclusion(s)



Vortex repulsion without considering currents - energy stuff?
Think about why density must be linear and not uniform
Reorder structure to make story clearer
Change description of pinning force - constant over space within cutoff, distinguish from time
Consider reworking animations to make final states clearer
Consider histograms for phase plots
Remove small event sizes?
